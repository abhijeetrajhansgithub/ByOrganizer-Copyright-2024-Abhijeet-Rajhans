This README file will guide you through the installation process on Windows.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* Python 3.x: Download Python
* PyQt5: Install using pip: `pip install pyqt5`
* WinRAR: Download and install WinRAR from the official website: https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

1. Clone the Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/abhijeetrajhansgithub/ByOrganizer-Copyright-2024-Abhijeet-Rajhans.git`

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
`cd ByOrganizer-Copyright-2024-Abhijeet-Rajhans`

3. Run the Installer:
Locate the installer file (ByOrganizer.exe) in the dist directory.

4. Double-click the installer to run it.
Once the installation is complete, you can run the app from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.

# Handling Split Archive Volumes
If your app's installer is split into multiple volumes, follow these steps to extract the installer:

1. Ensure All Volumes Are in the Same Directory:
      * Make sure all split archive volumes (installer.part1.rar, installer.part2.rar, etc.) are located in the same directory.
  
2. Select all split archive volumes
3. Right-click and open WinRAR
4. Choose **"Extract Here"** or **"Extract to [folder name]"** from the context menu.
5. WinRAR will begin extracting the files from the split archive volumes.
6. Once the extraction is complete, the installer file (**ByOrganizer.exe**) is in the extraction directory.


## More Documentation
1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If it's not installed, you can install it using the following command:
    ```sh
    pip install tk
    ```
3. **WinRAR**: Ensure WinRAR is installed on your system. You can download it from [rarlab.com](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm). WinRAR must be in your system PATH. If it's not, follow the instructions below to add it.

## Adding WinRAR to System PATH
If WinRAR is not recognized as an internal or external command, you need to add it to your system PATH.

1. **Check if WinRAR is installed**:
   - Default installation directory: `C:\Program Files\WinRAR`
   - If it's installed in this directory, follow the next steps to add it to the PATH.

2. **Add to PATH**:
    - Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
    - Click the "Environment Variables" button.
    - In the System variables section, find the `Path` variable and click "Edit".
    - Click "New" and add the path to the WinRAR installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\WinRAR`).
    - Click "OK" to save and close all windows.

3. **Install WinRAR using winget** (if WinRAR is not installed):
    - Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run:
      ```sh
      winget install winrar
      ```

## Installation Instructions
1. **Download the Project**: Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory on your computer.

2. **Download the Split RAR Files**: Ensure you have all the split RAR files required for the application. These files should be named starting with "ByOrganizer" and you should have exactly 8 files.

3. **Run the Merge and Extract Script**:
    - You can either use the provided Tkinter app or do it manually.

### Using the Tkinter App
1. **Run MergeWinRAR.exe**: This executable will automatically merge and extract the split RAR files.
    - Ensure all split RAR files are in the same directory as `MergeWinRAR.exe`.
    - Run `MergeWinRAR.exe`.
    - The merged and extracted files will be placed in a new directory called `extracted_files`.

### Manual Extraction Using WinRAR
1. **Open WinRAR**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the split RAR files.
    - Select the first file (e.g., `ByOrganizer.part1.rar`).
    - Right-click and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to <folder name>".
    - WinRAR will automatically merge the parts and extract the files.

## Running the Application
Once the extraction process is complete, navigate to the `extracted_files` directory and run the main executable of your PyQt5 application.
